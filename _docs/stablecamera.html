<p><b>System requirements</b></p>

<p>This requires Android 4.0 or better. I've tested this successfully on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus and Asus Nexus 7 (2013),
running Android 4.3. The auto-stabilise feature may not be available if the app deems there is not enough memory (RAM) available
(technical explanation: requires 128MB of "large heap").</p>

<p><b>Quickstart</b></p>

<p>Simply point, and press the blue camera icon <img src="take_photo.png" width="32" height="32"> to take a photo. The camera
will automatically focus before taking the picture. You can also focus at any time by touching on the screen.</p>

<p>To zoom, either press use the zoom "-" and "+" control buttons, or do a multi-touch "pinch" gesture.</p>

<p>You can also control via the volume keys on your phone or tablet - by default, pressing them will take a photo, but can change
this to zoom in/out from the Settings (see below).</p>

<p>When you take a photo, the image will be displayed - to keep the photo, touch the screen (or take another photo). To delete it,
press the trash icon <img src="trash.png" width="32" height="32">. To share an image, press the share icon
<img src="share.png" width="32" height="32">.

<p>On Android, the screen display is kept on when Stable Camera is running as the foreground app (if
you want to switch off the display, do so on your device manually).</p>

<p><b>On-Screen User Interface</b></p>

<p><img src="switch_camera.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Switch camera</b> - Switches between front and back camera (if your
device has two cameras).</p>

<p><img src="switch_video.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Switch to/from video</b> - Switches between taking photo mode, and
recording video mode.</p>

<p><img src="flash_auto.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Flash mode</b> - Click this to cycle through the available flash modes. Popup
text will explain what each mode is. (Only available if the camera supports flash.)</p>

<p><img src="focus_mode_auto.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Focus mode</b> - Click this to cycle through the available focus modes.
Popup text will explain what each mode is. (Only available if the camera supports different focus modes.)</p>

<p><img src="gallery.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Gallery</b> - Click to launch the Gallery app, to view your photos (by default
saved in the StableCamera folder).</p>

<p><img src="settings.png" width="32" height="32"><b>Settings</b> - Click to open the Settings (see below).</p>

<p><b>Auto-stabilise feature</b></p>

<p>All Android cameras will rotate the photo depending on the orientation of the camera, but only to the nearest 90 degrees - so the
photos look right whether you hold the device in "portrait" or "landscape" mode. But Stable Camera has the option to rotate the
photos so they are perfectly level, so your shots come out looking perfectly level every time!</p>

<p>Of course you won't always want this - perhaps you're going for artistic 45-degree shots - so this is an option. By default it
is disabled.  To enable, go to the Settings, and enable "Whether to auto-stabilise". Note that this feature is memory intensive -
it will not be available on devices with low memory. Even where it is available, there is a risk it may cause the app to fail on
devices I haven't been able to test. If you do have problems, you'll have to disable the feature again.</p>

<p>Also note that the feature reduces the available space in the image - because rotating an image makes it no longer fit into a
rectangular image, so we have to crop it. So it's still advisable to try to hold the camera reasonably level when using this
feature.</p>
